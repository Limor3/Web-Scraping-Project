# ITC_project
web scrapping

In this project we retrive data from the website: https://us.shein.com.
Because the website contains thousands of products, we decide to focus on dresses.
For each dress we gather data as: price, color, rating, style, etc...
For doing so, we used selenium and beautifulsoup packages and wrote the script in python.
