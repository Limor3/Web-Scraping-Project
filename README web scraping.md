web scrapping

In this project we retrive data from the website: https://us.shein.com.
Because the website contains thousands of products, we decide to focus on dresses.
For each dress we gather data as: price, color, rating, style, etc...
For doing so, we used selenium and beautifulsoup packages and wrote the script in python.

Please install requirements.txt file, and also all the files attached.

The main program is "SHEIN_web_scraping", that call the two additional files (selenium_html.py and data_product.py).
